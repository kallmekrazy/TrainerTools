# TrainerTools
Intuitive app intended for use by animal training professionals and hobbyists for record keeping and assessment. 

## Goals: 
- Easy to use even for non-technologically-savy individuals
- Informative. Hopefully users will find using the app an educational experience
- Scientifically useful. Ideally, real life, useable dog psych data could be gleaned with user's permission of course
- Helpful. Not just in the record keeping department. One of the key functional features will be assissting handlers in maintaining   
  objectvivity in their training and assessment.  
- Motivating, help handlers see progress that may otherwise not be especially obvious

## Ideas: 
- Recognition of markers other than the built in clicker
- Assessment of parameters other than latency (research required)
- Perhaps some assessment tools for things other than cues (like displacement gesture tracking, user input would be required, tap button
  every time you see your dog lick their lips, etc)
